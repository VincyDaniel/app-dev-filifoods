  "introduction": "What’s the first thing you think of cooking when you are in a rush? For me, Sarciadong Pechay is one of the recipes that easily comes to mind because all you really need to do is combine a bunch of commonly used ingredients in one pan. \n\nThat’s really all there is to it! That’s why I can easily recommend this to people who are still figuring out how to move around the kitchen. \n\nNow if you’ve had scrambled eggs before, as most of us have, this is a dish that is somewhat similar, but definitely, definitely more flavorful. Like every sarciado dish, this has a great sauce made of tomatoes and eggs. We mix that with some refreshing pechay for a truly tasty dish. One of the people I spoke to about Sarciadong Pechay described it as one of their favorites because it is able to highlight the flavors of each of its components perfectly.",
